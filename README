NEWS SUMMARIZER USING OpenAI's GPT-3.5 MODEL

This Python script fetches top headlines from the News API and summarizes each article's content using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. It leverages both the News API and OpenAI API to retrieve news data and generate summaries, respectively.

PREREQUISITES

Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

1.News API Key: Obtain an API key from News API to access their news data.
2.OpenAI API Key: Acquire an API key from OpenAI to use their GPT-3.5 model for text generation.
3.Python and Libraries: Make sure you have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries (requests).

USAGE

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE SET UP: Set the following environment variables:

1.newsapi: News API key
2.openaikey: OpenAI API key
3.Running the Script: Execute the Python script.

bash
Copy code
python main.py


1.Output: The script fetches top headlines from the News API for the US and generates summaries using GPT-3.5 for each article. It prints the title of each article along with its summary.


SCRIPT OVERVIEW

1.Fetch News Data: The script makes a request to the News API to get top headlines for the US.
2.Summarization: For each article, it checks if the content is available. If content exists, it generates a summary using GPT-3.5. If content is missing or empty, it skips the article.
3.Printing Results: The script prints the title of each article along with its summary.

NOTE

Ensure that you have sufficient API rate limits for both News API and OpenAI to avoid any issues during execution.
This script provides a basic implementation and can be extended further based on specific requirements and use cases.
